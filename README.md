files for KimTrip app pushed to github using git: uploaded 2022


Files uploaded by Alaya Spencer-Cotton

Code developed by Stuart Maisey as a University of Western Australia assignment for a course and also as a software consultant for Alaya Spencer-Cotton as part of her PhD research, 2018. 

This research was supported by PhD funding from the National Environmental Science Program (NESP), Northern Hub.

This app was developed as a travel survey and travel diary, where participants could log their trip route and record travel descisions along their trip in the remote Kimberley region of Western Australia. 


These are all the files used to create KimTrip mobile Application so there are likely to be unnessesary files in the folders. 

KimTrip, the applicaiton, starts with a short survey of questions to link the information to an online survey that particiapnts comapleted separatly before downloading the app. then the app goes to a home page. Here diary entries can be made that are like a mini survey (photos of the site can be added) and the entry is added to the diary posts and the site is marked on the map. 

The app can also create a basic PDF file of the diary entries with the map of sites logged at the start. Photos that are unploaded with an entry are also included in the PDF.  

Please feel free to use the application code for your university assignment, research project or not-for-profit or community project.
