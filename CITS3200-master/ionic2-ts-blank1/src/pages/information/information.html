	<p>This diary is part of a PhD project interested in learning about how people use the Kimberley
	landscape for recreation and self-drive tourism. Keeping this diary will help us to understand the
	values that people have for recreation, and the values they have for enjoying the nature of the
	Kimberley.</p>
	<p>Completing the diary will take less than 5 minutes each day of the trip to complete, and you will be
	given a daily reminder notification. Continue to make diary entries until you depart the Kimberley (or return home if you are a Kimberley resident).</p>
	<p>You do not need phone reception to make a diary entry. The diary will ask about your travel plans and
	some basic socio-demographic questions.</p>
	<p>Your privacy is important to us. Your participation in this study and any information you provide will
	be treated in a confidential manner, and will not be released by the investigator in any form that may
	identify you unless you have consented to this.</p>
	<p>The data will be kept in a de-identified format, in a password protected computer or a secure server
	for minimum seven years. Data collected from the smartphone APP will be automatically uploaded to
	a secure server and will be stored anonymously, with no identifiable information recorded.</p>
	<p>If you would like to discuss any aspect of this study please feel free to contact the researchers.</p>
